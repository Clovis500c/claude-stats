# Claude Stats

**Your Claude Code usage, as a live stats card for your GitHub profile.**

Sessions, prompts, tokens, models, top tools and an activity heatmap — computed locally from your Claude Code history, rendered as a self-contained SVG and refreshed automatically.

## Features

- **Complete overview** — sessions, prompts, active days, longest streak, generated tokens, tool calls, peak hour and favorite model.
- **Activity heatmap** — prompts per day, from 8 to 52 weeks.
- **Token and model breakdown** — what Claude wrote, what was added to context, what was re-read from cache, and the share of each model.
- **Honest numbers** — transcripts are de-duplicated before counting (see [below](#how-the-numbers-are-computed)).
- **Fully customizable** — dark, light or auto theme, 6 heatmap palettes, accent color, title, tiles and sections.
- **Automatic refresh** — from every hour to once a week, only committing when something changed.
- **Private by design** — only aggregated numbers leave your machine.
- **Zero dependencies** — a single Node.js CLI, works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **18 or later**
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with some local history in `~/.claude/projects`
- A GitHub token, from either:
  - the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh auth login`) — recommended, or
  - a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with write access to the target repository (`contents: write`)

## Quick start

Install the latest release, then run the guided setup:

```bash
npm i -g https://github.com/Clovis500c/claude-stats/releases/latest/download/claude-stats.tgz
claude-stats setup
```

Or run it without installing anything:

```bash
npx -y --package=https://github.com/Clovis500c/claude-stats/releases/latest/download/claude-stats.tgz claude-stats setup
```

The setup will:

1. read your local Claude Code history (`~/.claude/projects`);
2. render the card (dark theme by default);
3. upload it to your profile repository (`<you>/<you>` by default);
4. ask how often it should refresh (every hour to once a week, or never);
5. print the snippet to paste into your `README.md`:

```html
<img alt="Claude Code usage" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<you>/<you>/HEAD/claude-stats/claude-stats.svg" />
```

> [!TIP]
> Preview the card locally before publishing anything:
> `claude-stats --palette green --out preview` writes `preview/claude-stats.svg`.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `claude-stats setup` | Guided setup: publish, choose the refresh frequency, get the snippet |
| `claude-stats` | Write `claude-stats.svg` to the current folder (or `--out <dir>`) |
| `claude-stats push` | Render and upload; only commits when the card changed |
| `claude-stats schedule --every <freq>` | Set the refresh frequency: `1h`, `6h`, `12h`, `1d`, `7d` |
| `claude-stats unschedule` | Stop the automatic refresh |
| `claude-stats --help` | Show every option |
| `claude-stats --version` | Show the installed version |

## Customization

`setup` asks for the main options; every option can also be passed on the command line. Options are remembered by the automatic refresh.

### Appearance

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--theme <dark\|light\|auto>` | Card theme; `auto` follows the visitor's GitHub theme | `dark` |
| `--palette <name>` | Heatmap colors: `blue`, `green`, `orange`, `purple`, `pink`, `gray` | `blue` |
| `--accent <hex>` | Color of the Claude logo and of the bars | `#d97757` |
| `--title <text>` | Card title | `Claude Code usage` |
| `--weeks <8-52>` | Number of weeks in the heatmap | `26` |
| `--tiles <list>` | Stat tiles to show, in order (see below) | first 8 |
| `--hide <list>` | Sections to leave out: `header`, `tiles`, `heatmap`, `book`, `tokens`, `models`, `tools` | none |
| `--transparent` | No card background | off |
| `--cost` | Adds a banner with what the last 30 days would have cost at API prices (see [Spend banner](#spend-banner)) | off |

Available tiles: `sessions`, `prompts`, `activeDays`, `streak`, `generated`, `toolCalls`, `peakHour`, `favorite`, `responses`, `processed`.

### Content and publishing

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--lang <en\|fr>` | Card language | `en` |
| `--range <all\|30d\|7d>` | Period covered by the numbers (the heatmap always shows its full length) | `all` |
| `--name <user>` | Name shown in the header | repository owner |
| `--repo <owner/name>` | Target repository | `<you>/<you>` |
| `--dir <path>` | Folder inside the repository | `claude-stats` |
| `--branch <name>` | Target branch | repository default |

### Examples

| | |
|---|---|
| <img src="examples/green-52-weeks.svg" width="400" /><br>`--palette green --accent "#39d353" --weeks 52` | <img src="examples/purple-compact.svg" width="400" /><br>`--palette purple --accent "#8c70e6" --title "My AI pair-programming" --hide tokens,models,tools` |
| <img src="examples/light-pink.svg" width="400" /><br>`--theme light --palette pink --accent "#cc4589" --hide tools` | <img src="examples/stats-only.svg" width="400" /><br>`--tiles prompts,generated,streak,favorite --hide heatmap,tools --palette orange` |
| <img src="examples/heatmap-only.svg" width="400" /><br>`--hide header,tiles,book,tokens,models,tools --palette gray --transparent` | <img src="examples/cost-banner.svg" width="400" /><br>`--cost --hide tiles,heatmap,book,tokens,models,tools` |

### Light and dark mode

With `--theme auto`, two files are published (`claude-stats.svg` and `claude-stats-light.svg`) and `setup` prints a `<picture>` snippet so GitHub shows the one matching each visitor's theme.

## How it works

```
~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl ──► aggregate (local) ──► SVG card ──► GitHub contents API ──► your README
```

### Why not a GitHub Action?

Tools like the contribution snake read data that already lives on GitHub. Your Claude Code usage only lives **on your computer** — there is no public API for personal (Pro/Max) usage. The refresh therefore runs locally and pushes the SVG; the card updates whenever your machine is on.

### Automatic refresh

A job (Task Scheduler on Windows, cron on macOS and Linux) wakes up every hour and only uploads once the chosen interval has elapsed since the last successful upload. If your computer was off when a refresh was due, it happens within an hour of being back on. Nothing is committed when the numbers haven't changed.

## Privacy

Only aggregated numbers end up in the SVG: counts, token totals, per-day prompt counts, model names and the names of your most-used tools. **No prompts, code, file names or project names ever leave your machine.** Use `--hide tools` to leave tool names off the card. The spend banner is off by default, since it shows an amount of money on your public profile.

The GitHub token is read from `gh` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` at run time and is never stored by this tool. The only file it writes outside the output folder is `~/.claude-usage-chart.json`, which records the time of the last upload per repository.

## How the numbers are computed

Claude Code transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`) contain a lot of repetition, so they are de-duplicated before counting:

- one API response is written as several lines (one per content block), each repeating the same token usage → each response is counted **once**;
- resumed sessions copy earlier messages into a new file → each message is counted **once**;
- most "user" lines are tool results or system notices → only messages you actually typed count as **prompts**;
- subagent traffic is excluded (except from the spend banner: subagents are billed too).

| Stat | Definition |
|---|---|
| Sessions | Distinct Claude Code sessions |
| Prompts | Messages you typed (no tool results, no system messages) |
| Active days · Longest streak | Days with at least one prompt or response · most consecutive such days |
| Tokens generated | Output tokens: everything Claude wrote (text, code, tool calls, thinking) |
| Tool calls · Top tools | Tool uses by Claude, each counted once · the most frequent ones |
| Peak hour | Hour of the day with the most prompts |
| Favorite model | Model that generated the most output tokens |
| Heatmap | Prompts per day over the last `--weeks` weeks |
| **Tokens** bar | *Written by Claude* = output · *Added to context* = input + cache writes (files read, command results…) · *Re-read from cache* = cache reads — Claude re-reads the whole conversation at every step, which is why this part is by far the largest |
| **Models** bar | Share of output tokens per model |
| Book line | Output tokens compared with the length of a well-known book |

Numbers can differ from the Claude app's stats card, which sums the repeated lines.

### Spend banner

`--cost` adds a banner with the cost of the last 30 days of Claude Code usage, **estimated at Anthropic API list prices**, like Claude Code's own cost display. Each response is priced by model: input, cache writes (1.25× input for the 5-minute cache, 2× for the 1-hour cache), cache reads, output, fast mode (2×) and web searches ($10 per 1,000). Subagents are included.

On a Pro or Max plan this is the API value of what you used, not what you paid. Responses from models without a known price are left out; `claude-stats` (without `push`) prints how many.

<details>
<summary><strong>The book comparison</strong></summary>

Book lengths use commonly cited English word counts, converted at ~1.3 tokens per word, so the comparison is an estimate (output also contains code and tool calls). The card picks the longest book Claude's output fits into at least 10 times, so the number stays readable.

| Book | Words |
|---|---:|
| The Great Gatsby | 47,094 |
| Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone | 76,944 |
| The Hobbit | 95,356 |
| Moby-Dick | 206,052 |
| The Lord of the Rings | 481,103 |
| The King James Bible | 783,137 |
| In Search of Lost Time | 1,267,069 |

</details>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `No Claude Code transcripts found` | Use Claude Code at least once. If you set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, the tool reads `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects` instead of `~/.claude/projects`. |
| `No GitHub token` | Run `gh auth login`, or set `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |
| `GitHub PUT … → 403` / `404` | The token can't write to the repository: check `--repo` and that the token has `contents: write` access. |
| The card on GitHub looks outdated | GitHub caches images for a few minutes. Check that the SVG in the repository was updated, then reload. |
| History looks shorter than expected | Claude Code deletes old transcripts after `cleanupPeriodDays` (see `~/.claude/settings.json`). Raise it to keep a longer history. |
| The refresh doesn't run | Run `claude-stats push` manually to see the error, then `claude-stats schedule --every 1d` to recreate the job. |

## Uninstall

```bash
claude-stats unschedule
npm rm -g claude-stats
rm ~/.claude-usage-chart.json   # optional: last-upload bookkeeping
```

Then remove the `claude-stats/` folder and the snippet from your profile repository.
