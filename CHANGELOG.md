## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- `--cost`: optional banner with the cost of the last 30 days at API prices (off by default), also asked by `setup`.
- The local summary printed after a render shows that cost.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- Renamed the project to **Claude Stats**: repository `claude-stats`, package and command `claude-stats`, release file `claude-stats.tgz`. The `claude-usage-chart` command and release file remain available so existing installs and scheduled refreshes keep working.
- The release workflow can also be run by hand from the Actions tab; it then tags the commit with the `package.json` version.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- `--version` / `-v` flag.
- Readable summary after a local render instead of the raw stats object.
- Unit tests (`npm test`) and CI on Linux, macOS and Windows with Node 18, 20 and 22.
- Release workflow: pushing a `v*` tag publishes the release and its `claude-usage-chart.tgz`.
- Issue templates, changelog.

### Fixed
- Scheduled refresh on macOS/Linux broke when an option (such as `--title`) contained `%`, and could expand `$`, backticks or quotes in the shell.
- Scheduled refresh when first run through `npx` pointed at a package that isn't on npm; it now uses the latest GitHub release.
- Invalid `--theme`, `--lang`, `--range` or `--repo` values are now rejected instead of silently ignored.
- `--dir` values with spaces or special characters are now URL-encoded for the GitHub API.

### Changed
- README rewritten: requirements, option tables, troubleshooting, uninstall and contributing sections.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- Claude logo in the card header.
- Customization: heatmap palettes, accent color, title, tiles, sections, heatmap length, transparent background.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- Token breakdown, models and top tools sections; book-length comparison.
- Configurable refresh frequency; de-duplicated, honest stats.
- English and French cards, light/dark/auto themes, guided `setup`.
